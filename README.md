## Motivation and history
I've decided to write this simple script as a proof of concept/personal challenge: can I process a large text file without needing to write a dedicated app with native file access.
After I browse the web to check the current HTML specifications, I found that the HTML5 File API will be a feasible candidate for this type of project.
So with a few lines of code and some NPM libraries, I wrote this simple script to process my GCODE files. Because I am currently learning Angular, I've decided to give a chance to this technology and use it to create the UI (I know that it's overkill, but it's better to start with a small project).
